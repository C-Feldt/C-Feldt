**`Web Designer & Novice Game Developer`**

I'm an undergraduate at Louisiana State University studying Computer Science! I've worked professionally, independently, and with fellow students to produce and improve web applications, where I particularly focused on front-end-design. I've gained experience in a variety of languages and can learn new ones quickly. Many of my projects here were developed for courses, while some of them were also independently produced.

  <summary><h3>ðŸ“– My Coding Story<h3></summary>
    When I was a kid, I loved Legos. Not just the sets with specific instructions, but also the boxes of whatever random pieces Lego had lying around. I always felt so happy to put together a cool new creation. Fast forward a few years to when Santa Clause gifted me a Wii (I was very good that year, what can I say?), I discovered another one of my passions: video games! Though it wasn't until high school that these two interests really mixed together. I took AP Computer Science out of curiosity and was hooked from the very first time I typed "Hello World!" I enrolled at LSU in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering hoping it wouldn't be too difficult, and even some classes have made me question my sanity, I've only grown to love this field even more. Every new project feels like putting more Legos together to make another big creation. I've begun experimenting with game development and am looking to gain professional experience in the industry as the next step in my career.
